## Objective
-------------

This project approaches the problem of optimizing infrastructure technologies 
as a continuous multi objective combinatorial optimization problem in a dynamic environment

Meta-Heuristics, e.g. Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), have been found operating well in
such optimization problem fields.

Technologies throughout the stack are targeted.

Overall optimizing, rearranging, calibrating of technology settings throughout the life-cycle of an instance
of a technology are what is seeked to address with godon.

## Sponsors

Greatest esteem to:

* OSU Open Source Lab (https://osuosl.org) for bestowing generously with resources on their openstack infrastructure

* genesiscloud (https://www.genesiscloud.com/) for providing free GPU acceleration to the project
